== Trimming of the reads ==
{{{
perl trim-fastq.pl --input1 s_7_1_sequence_Jul2009.fastq --input2 s_7_2_sequence_Jul2009.fastq --quality-threshold 20 --min-length 50 --output dmel_trimed
}}}
=== Resulting trimming statistics ===


== Mapping of the reads ==

=== Prepare reference sequence ===
First obtain a reference genome of D. melanogaster from http://flybase.org/

We used: dmel-all-chromosome-r5.22.fasta.gz

Remove everything after the first whitespace from the reference genome. This is a precautioniary measure as some mappers and software downstream of mapping have difficulties with fasta-ids containing whitespace.
{{{
awk '{print $1}' dmel-all-chromosome-r5.22.fasta >dmel-short-header.fa
}}}

Index the reference sequence
